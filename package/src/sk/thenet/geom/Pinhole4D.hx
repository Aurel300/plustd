##4D-to-3D pinhole camera##

This is a 4D equivalent of `Pinhole3D`. It works analogously to the simpler
model â€“ the last coordinate (`w`) of the point is used to estimate the
perspective scaling. The result of a projection is a 3D point. Another pinhole
camera (potentially with a different focal length) can then be used to project
to 2D.
