/**
##Mouse##

Base class for mouse handler implementations. Generally accessible through
`sk.thenet.plat.Platform.mouse` or `sk.thenet.app.Application.mouse`,
if using the application model.

This class keeps track of where the mouse is on screen, as well as whether the
mouse button is being held.

If the application surface was initialised with a scaling factor, the
coordinates in `Mouse.x` and `Mouse.y` contains the adjusted coordinates,
not the raw surface coordinates.

@see `sk.thenet.event.EMEvent`
