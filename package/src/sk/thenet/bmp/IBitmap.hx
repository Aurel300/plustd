/**
##Bitmap interface##

This interface represents a two-dimensional image consisting of 32-bit ARGB
(alpha, red, green, blue; 8 bits per channel) values. It supports pixel
manipulation by getting / setting individual pixels (`Bitmap.get()` and
`Bitmap.set()`) or by getting / setting vectors. In almost all cases,
the latter has much better performance because there is no function-call
overhead for every single pixel.

Implementations of this interface are platform-dependent. To maintain good
performance without having to actually cast classes to this interface, there
is a typedef available - `sk.thenet.bmp.Bitmap` - which becomes an alias for
the current platform-dependent implementation of `IBitmap` at compile time. To
actually create a `Bitmap`, use `sk.thenet.plat.Platform.createBitmap()`.

Many common bitmap operations were abstracted into the `bmp.manip` package,
instead of being members of this interface.

####Equivalent classes####

`Bitmap` in plustd is roughly equivalent to these classes in other languages:

 - C++ / SDL: `SDLTexture` (`SDLSurface` is not used!)
 - Flash: `flash.display.BitmapData`
 - JavaScript / Canvas: `CanvasElement` (with a 2D rendering context)
