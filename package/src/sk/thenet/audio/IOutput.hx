/**
##Audio output##

This interface represents a code-generated audio output.

Implementations of this interface are platform-dependent, thus they can be
found in `sk.thenet.plat`. To actually create a `Output`, use
`sk.thenet.plat.Platform.createAudioOutput()`.

Implementations of this interface are platform-dependent. To maintain good
performance without having to actually cast classes to this interface, there
is a typedef available - `sk.thenet.audio.Output` - which becomes an alias for
the current platform-dependent implementation of `IOutput` at compile time. To
actually create an `Output`, use `sk.thenet.plat.Platform.createAudioOutput()`.
